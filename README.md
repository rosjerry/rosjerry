### Hi there

I used to have a bad habit.  
Whenever I researched something new, I would create a local directory, extract what I found important, and then either forget about it or delete it.  
Because of that, I ended up forgetting many things I had learned. I lost time remembering them fro scratch.

Now I’ve decided to change that by customizing my GitHub profile to fit my needs.

I will include every repository related to the stacks I’ve ever explored.  
I will create boilerplates for quick project starts.  
I will keep empty public repos to remind myself of things I plan to work on in the near future.

You’ll start seeing a more organized and meaningful GitHub profile in the next few weeks.
